# By default, the compliance-operator will install into a dedicated namespace.

# The default platform for the compliance-operator. Available platforms are

# By default, the compliance-operator will deploy to nodes tagged with the
# master kubernetes role, which is present in OpenShift deployments. You may
# need to omit this option to run the compliance-operator on other platforms,
# like EKS, where nodes do not have that role by default (e.g., nodeSelector:
# null)
nodeSelector:
  node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""

# By default, only schedule to nodes labeled with the master kubernetes role,
# which is present in OpenShift deployments. You may need to omit this option
# to run the compliance-operator on other platforms, like EKS, where nodes are
# not tainted with the master role by default (e.g., tolerations: null)
